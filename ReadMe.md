## **Vinland Saga – Seasons 1 & 2  - Review**  
  
### **1. Quick plot**  
Season 1 starts with loud Viking battles. A sneaky prince named Canute and a super-strong boy, Thorfinn, both want revenge for different reasons. Season 2 jumps five years ahead: Thorfinn is now a quiet slave on a farm in Denmark instead of a fighter. The swords are still there, but the story talks more about “what does it mean to be truly strong?” than about who swings the biggest axe.  
  
### 2. What’s cool      
- You actually learn a bit of real history  
- Season 2 feels like a different show: less blood, but still exciting.    
  
### 3. What’s less cool    
- Season 1 is pretty violent. Heads roll, literally. If you don’t like blood, skip the first three episodes.    
- Some episodes in the middle of Season 2 are slow, like “watching grass grow on a Viking farm” slow.    
- Hard to pronounce names: “Thorkell the Tall” is fun to say, “Askeladd” sounds like a pasta.  
  
### 4. Characters you will remember    
- Thorfinn: starts as an angry kid, ends up trying to be a pacifist—big change.    
- Einar: the new best buddy in Season 2, always optimistic, good role model.    
- Canute: from shy prince to scary king, proves glasses can be evil.  
  
### 5. Should you watch it?    
If you like action AND thinking about why people fight, yes. Start with Season 1 if you can handle animated blood. If you only want cozy farming and friendship, jump to Season 2; the show tells you everything you need to know in the first episode. Recommended for ages 13+
